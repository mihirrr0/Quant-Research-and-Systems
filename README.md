# Quant Research and Systems

This repository consolidates the trading systems and backtests I have developed during my undergraduate studies in Information Technology, showcasing a systematic approach to designing and evaluating algorithmic trading strategies, with a particular focus on options strategies. Each project within this collection explores specific methodologies, optimizations, and performance metrics, reflecting a blend of financial market understanding and technical implementation. The repository is structured to provide clear documentation of the research processes, results, and key insights gained over four years of continuous refinement. Submitted as part of my application for a Masterâ€™s program in Financial Engineering, it serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating my proficiency in options trading strategies and my ability to analyze, optimize, and execute data-driven trading systems within diverse market conditions.
